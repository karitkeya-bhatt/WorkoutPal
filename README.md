## WorkoutPal
I designed this app in order to track my workouts at the gym over a 7 day split! Record weights/sets/reps of custom workouts.

Here is a rough outline of what I worked on:

- Built the frontend of the app using Flutter SDK
- Implemented Http requests in JSON using Spring Boot 
- Stored the data using MongoDB to enable persistence 
- Hosted the backend server on the cloud with an AWS EC2 instance
